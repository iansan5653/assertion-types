# # Security Policy

I am extremely dedicated to ensuring the security of this library. In order to
ensure that goal, I keep the complexity of the library to an absolute minimum,
and only use dependencies that I trust completely.

## Supported Versions

All versions are actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerability reports will always be handled with absolute priority. The best
way to report a vulnerability is to
[notify NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=PACKAGE_NAME), who
will analyze your report and take the appropriate action along with alerting me.
